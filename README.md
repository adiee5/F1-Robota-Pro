# F1 Robota Pro
*F1 Robota Pro* is a F1 race simulator I've made back in 2022 for the use in F1 roleplay discord servers we used to make with my friend back in a day. You can configure the stats of Drivers, Teams, weather, etc. Keep in mind, that the whole thing is in Polish language, there is no english translation of the program.

As of writing this, I'm currently in the process of learning Rust and I plan to port this program to Rust once I get a hang of it. 

## Building
Just clone the repo, open it in Visual Studio 2019 or newer and compile it using that. Other methods have not been tested.

## Documentation
See *[docs](/docs/)* to get more info about this program.
